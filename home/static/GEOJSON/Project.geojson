The loss can be especially difficult as others may not fully appreciate the impact of the loss of a non-family member. The first of three programs for the 2018 Begin With the End in Mind series will discuss Disenfranchised Grief, grief that is not recognized by others. The term, disenfranchised grief was first described by Kenneth Doka and continues to have meaning today as more people live well into their older adult years and face the loss of friends, co-workers and neighbors. Cathy Fox, MSW is the first presenter. She is the Director of Operations for Grief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journey (formerly Ted E. Bear Hollow). In her role she is responsible for development, implementation, and management of all Grief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journey programs. Her passion for the care and support of grieving families is evident in her work.

The ultimate implications of this view are then projected onto an extended evolutionary perspective of our cosmos, encompassing rising levels of complexity from physical to biological, psychological, and social levels. Considering the exponential rise of artificial intelligence in the future post-information society, the talk is concluded with an urgent call for all creativity researchers to join forces in the diffusion of a discipline of creativity, with relevant educational programs.

Forty years ago this November, Manolis Andronikos found three tombs at Vergina in Greece that he considered royal, one of which he believed to be that of Philip II, the great Macedonian king, general, and father of Alexander the Great. Almost from the moment of the discovery, others have disagreed with Andronikos. Yet Tomb II contained not only a male burial but also that of a woman. Military equipment made it clear that she had been buried as a warrior. Her burial resembles the male in a number of aspects, including a slightly smaller and simpler golden burial box with the same starburst pattern, as well as a distinctive Scythian bow-and-arrow case and an elaborately decorated gold cuirass. While the lecture plans to discuss the identity of both occupants, the intended focus is to discuss primarily the woman. That is, who she was and why she was buried as a warrior.","Academic Year":"2017-18","Legislative District Number":"","College Name":"College of Arts and Sciences","Campus Partner":"History, Department of","Community Partner":"Clemson University","Mission Area":"Educational Support","Address Line1":"N\/A","City":"N\/A","State":"N\/A","Zip":"None"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.4420401,34.038395]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Project Name":"The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening our Planet, Destroying our Politics, and Driving us Crazy: 2016-17 (001)","Engagement Type":"Knowledge\/Info Sharing","Activity Type":"Training \/ Workshop \/ Presentation","Description":"Distinguised climate scientist Dr. Michael E.

The American Association of University Women (AAUW) recently published a 2017 report called \"Deeper in Debt: Women and Student Loans,\" which explores the question of how student debt became a women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issue. This event will take a closer look at how student debt can affect women, particularly women of color, following graduation as they enter the workforce. AAUW helps shed light on intersected issues including the gender wage gap and provides a foundation of research and resources to our communities as we ask what can be done about student debt.
